This is not a real post, just a link to the list of [books]
(https://github.com/risuwwv/Books/blob/master/README.md) I added on github.

It contains machine learning, C++, Python, software development and algorithm books that I read or plan to read.

Please free to comment or propose me others related to those topics!
