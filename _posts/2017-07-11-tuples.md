This is a very short post on something I found while working on a generic Radix Sort.



In C++17, it is now possible to deduce class template arguments:

```cpp 
#include <tuple>
#include <type_traits>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	tuple t(4, 3, 2.5); //class template arguments deduction
	static_assert(is_same_v<decltype(t), tuple<int, int, double>>);
}
```

This however does not (despite what I initially thought...) make *std::make_tuple* useless!

In generic code, I had wrote something like:

```cpp 
template<typename... Ts>
auto testFun1(Ts... v)
{
	return tuple{v...};
}
```

instead of 

```cpp 
template<typename... Ts>
auto testFun2(Ts... v)
{
	return make_tuple(v...);
}
```

The actual piece of code was extracting the tail of a tuple: 
From a tuple *t1*, I wanted to get a tuple *t2* = *t1* with *std::get<0>(t1)* removed from it.

However:

`testFun1(tuple{0.0, 1})` returns a `tuple<double, int>`.

while 

`testFun2(tuple{0.0, 1})` returns a `tuple<tuple<double, int>>`!

### Moral of the story: extensive unit tests are nice!

Next posts will be on radix sort itself.
